This project will allow you to calculate your weight on different planets.

// We're going to solve this by breaking the problem into three parts.
// Programmers like automating things, we'll populate the HTML drop down options using code,
// instead of having to type out all the values.
// Create a function that does the some math and gives us the new weight.
// Then create a function that responds when the user clicks on the button.

// 1. Populate the dropdown element with the data found in the planets array.
// The value of each option should be the planet's name.
// Use the following built-in methods:
// `.forEach` `document.createElement` `document.getElementById` `.appendChild`



function calculateWeight(weight, planetName) {
  // 2. Write the code to return the correct weight

}

function handleClickEvent(e) {
  // 3. Create a variable called userWeight and assign the value of the user's weight.

  // 4. Create a variable called planetName and assign the name of the selected planet from the drop down.

  // 5. Create a variable called result and assign the value of the new calculated weight.

  // 6. Write code to display the message shown in the screenshot.

}

// 7. Set the #calculate-button element's onclick method to use the handleClickEvent function.

// Bonus Challenges
// 8. Reverse the drop down order so that the sun is first.
// 9. Make it look nice using bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/)
